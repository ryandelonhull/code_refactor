# code_refactor

Refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible. Ensure that all links are functioning correctly and clean up the CSS to make it more efficient, consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

Getting Started
A copy of the HTML and CSS files need to be pulled and brought into Visual Studio Code. 

I changed the footer div to footer.

I changed the head title from website to Horiseon.

Added a header tag before the div class="header" and added a footer tag out side the changed div class=footer. I changed the CSS header from header div to header nav and changed div to nav in the header in html for the nav bar.

Added main tag to encompass the main content of the page.
